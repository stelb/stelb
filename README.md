### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Me on
* <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@stelb">Mastodon</a>
* <a rel="me" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanlebreton">LinkedIn</a>

I am working as DBA (Oracle, postgres) since 1999. But I do more than only Databases.

Linux administration, mail servers, application servers, firewall, loadbalancer, storage, virtualization, monitoring, docker, kubernetes, ansible, certificates.

I am interested in far too much topics, not enough time for all :)


# Non-Business Projects
I am plugging together technologies to make things work for me

## 'Production' important stuff for me
### Mailserver
* [Mailcow](https://mailcow.email/)
* added https://mta-sts.*/.well-known/mta-sts.txt URLs
* added backup with borgmatic
* probably I will add external IDM

### Passwordsafe
* [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden)
* nothing special, just automatic paranoid backup, because it will be a major pain to lose data ðŸ˜…

### Document Management
Just started, no more paper, all digital documents in one place and not cluttered on disks or in mails.
* [paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/)
* scanservjs (scan directly to consume folder)
* Integration with IDM
* Sharelinks accessible from outside (wireguard tunnel, caddy, opnsense)
* Let's encrypt Certificates at home (DNS-01 validation, RFC2136, technitium DNS)
* import via mail rules/share/directly from scanner to share

### Identity MAnagement
* [kanidm](https://kanidm.com/)
* everything via commandline
* just for oauth2 until now, maybe later for ldap or unix users

### Routing/Firewall
* OpnSense
* wireguard

### NAS

* TrueNAS (Core, not sure about Scale as of now)

## Lab
### proxmox
### Kubernetes
* talos
* kind
